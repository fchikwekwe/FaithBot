Welcome to Tweet Recall 🐦 !

This twitter bot makes interacting with consumers easier by helping to like 👍 , retweet 📱 and archive 🗄 tweets that meet certain criteria.

Tweet Recall is currently is test-only mode 👩🏾‍🔬.

Proposal --
Tweet Recall is an application that will access the Twitter API in order to like and respond to tweets that feature certain hashtags. It can also archive potentially interesting tweets and store them in a database (and potentially display them on a website for the admin).

This is a social media tool that could help to automate some actions for a startup with limited time to commit to interacting with their consumers online.
