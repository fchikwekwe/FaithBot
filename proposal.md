Faith's Twitter Bot is an application that accesses the Twitter API in order to send, like and respond to tweets that are related to certain hashtags. It will also archive potentially interesting tweets and store them in a database (and potentially display them on a website for the admin).

This is a social media tool that could help to automate some actions for a startup with limited time to commit to interacting with their consumers online.
